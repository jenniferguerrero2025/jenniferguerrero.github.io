	<p class="lead">Hi! I'm <span itemprop="name">Jennifer Guerrero</span>, a 4th year graduate student in mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.<br><small><small>(Deewang is pronounced as "thee-waang".)</small></small></p>

	<p>My research interests lie broadly in group theory and its relation with representation theory. My advisor is <a href="https://boltje.math.ucsc.edu//">Robert Boltje</a>. I am passionate about mathematics pedagogy, and communicating mathematics to a general audience. I am committed to promoting inclusivity, diversity and justice in the mathematics community.

		Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my M.A. and my B.A. in Mathematics at Sacramento State University.
